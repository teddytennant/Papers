### Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence in Legal Practice: Emphasizing Confidentiality through Self-Hosted Large Language Models

**Author:** Theodore Tennant

Explores the responsible application of AI in legal practice, with emphasis on confidentiality and data protection. Examines how self-hosted LLMs can safeguard client confidentiality compared to third-party cloud services. Addresses ethical considerations including competence, oversight, bias mitigation, and accountability, drawing on ABA guidelines.

### Canonical Vocabulary Compression: A Synonym-Mapping Approach to LLM Training Efficiency

**Author:** Theodore Tennant

Proposes Canonical Vocabulary Compression (CVC), a paradigm for improving LLM efficiency by preprocessing both training data and user inputs to eliminate lexical redundancy. Maps synonym variants into canonical representations, hypothesizing improvements in training efficiency, inference robustness, and task accuracy. Outlines a comprehensive framework including synonym-to-canonical mapping, meaning retention validation, and inference-time input normalization.
